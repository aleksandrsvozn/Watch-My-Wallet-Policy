      <p>
        This Privacy Policy explains how the <strong>Watch My Wallet</strong> mobile application (the “<strong>App</strong>”)
        collects, uses, stores, and shares information. By using the App, you acknowledge that you have read and understood this Policy.

      <h2>1) Owner / Data Controller</h2>
      <p><strong>Owner / Controller:</strong> Aleksandrs Voznarskis<br />
         <strong>Contact Email:</strong> <a href="mailto:aleksandrsvoz@gmail.com">aleksandrsvoz@gmail.com</a><br />

    <section>
      <h2>2) Scope</h2>
      <p>
        This Policy applies to the App and related services and integrations used through the App (e.g., Google Drive, Google Play services, Firebase).
        If a public website is later created, this Policy may be published there; until then, it is provided via the App listing and/or repository page.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>3) Summary (Key Points)</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>The App primarily stores your finance data <strong>on your device</strong> and, if you enable it, <strong>in your Google Drive account</strong>.</li>
        <li>The App uses <strong>analytics and diagnostics</strong> (e.g., Firebase Analytics and Crashlytics) to improve stability and user experience.</li>
        <li>The App may use <strong>remote configuration / A/B testing</strong> services (e.g., Firebase Remote Config / A/B Testing) to evaluate features and improve the App.</li>
        <li>The App may support <strong>Google Play subscriptions</strong> in the future; Google processes payments.</li>
        <li>Some identifiers may be collected by SDKs. If Firebase Authentication is added, the App may process account identifiers (e.g., email and user ID) to support sign-in/sync.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>4) Information We Collect</h2>
      <p>The App is designed to work without requiring you to create an account. Depending on the features you use and the services enabled, we may process the following categories:</p>

      <h3>A) User-Provided Data (Financial &amp; Personal Content)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Financial data you enter:</strong> transactions, categories, budgets, balances, notes, and related records.</li>
        <li><strong>Attachments/content you add:</strong> optional notes, labels, or files (if you choose to attach/import them).</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>B) Cloud Sync / Storage Data (Google Drive)</h3>
      <p>If you enable sync/backup, the App will store or read data files in <strong>your Google Drive</strong>. This can include financial records you created in the App.</p>

      <h3>C) Identifiers</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>App instance / device-related identifiers</strong> may be collected by analytics/diagnostics SDKs.</li>
        <li>If sign-in is added (e.g., Firebase Authentication), we may also process <strong>account identifiers</strong> such as email address and a user ID assigned by the authentication provider.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>D) Usage Data (Analytics)</h3>
      <p>Interaction data such as screens visited, feature usage, session information, and aggregated engagement metrics.</p>

      <h3>E) Diagnostics (Crash &amp; Performance)</h3>
      <p>Crash logs, error reports, and performance diagnostics (typically including device model, OS version, app version, time of crash, and event context).</p>

      <h3>F) Device / Technical Data</h3>
      <p>Device model, OS version, language, region settings, app version, and general technical information required to operate the App.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>5) How We Use Information</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Provide core functionality (personal finance tracking, reports, categories).</li>
        <li>Save, restore, sync, and back up data (if you enable Google Drive sync/backup).</li>
        <li>Improve reliability, performance, and user experience (analytics/diagnostics).</li>
        <li>Run experiments and feature rollouts (A/B tests, remote configuration).</li>
        <li>Respond to your support requests.</li>
        <li>Comply with legal obligations when required.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>6) Legal Bases (GDPR / EEA Users)</h2>
      <p>Where GDPR applies, we rely on:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Contract / performance of a contract:</strong> to provide requested features (e.g., exporting/importing, sync/backup you enable).</li>
        <li><strong>Consent:</strong> where required for optional analytics or similar features, depending on configuration and applicable law.</li>
        <li><strong>Legitimate interests:</strong> to improve and secure the App, prevent abuse, and maintain stability (balanced against your rights).</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>7) Sharing and Third Parties</h2>
      <p>We do <strong>not</strong> sell your personal data. We may share or process data with the following categories of service providers, only as necessary:</p>

      <h3>A) Google Drive (Cloud Storage / Sync)</h3>
      <p>If you enable sync/backup, data is stored in <strong>your Google Drive account</strong>. Your Google account settings determine who can access or share Drive files.</p>

      <h3>B) Firebase (Analytics / Crash Reporting / Remote Config / A-B Testing)</h3>
      <p>We may use Firebase services such as Firebase Analytics, Firebase Crashlytics, and Firebase Remote Config / A/B Testing. These services may collect device/usage/diagnostic data per their own terms and policies.</p>

      <h3>C) Google Play Services and Billing (Subscriptions / Payments)</h3>
      <p>If subscriptions or in-app purchases are offered, payment processing is handled by <strong>Google Play Billing</strong>. Google may process purchase and subscription data to complete transactions and comply with legal requirements.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>8) Google Drive Permissions / Scopes (General)</h2>
      <p>
        When you connect Google Drive, the App requests the permissions/scopes needed to access the specific file(s) it creates/uses for backup/sync and/or access App-stored data in Drive (depending on implementation).
        We request only the minimum permissions required for the feature to work. You can revoke access at any time through your Google account settings.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>9) Data Export / Import (Beyond Google Drive)</h2>
      <p>
        The App may allow exporting or importing your data (e.g., local files).
        When you export, you choose where the exported file is stored and who you share it with. You are responsible for securing exported files and controlling any sharing.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>10) Data Storage and Retention</h2>

      <h3>A) Storage Locations</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>On-device:</strong> the App stores your data locally to provide offline functionality.</li>
        <li><strong>Google Drive (optional):</strong> if you enable sync/backup, data files are stored in your Google Drive.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>B) Retention</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Financial records:</strong> retained until you delete them in the App and/or delete associated files from Google Drive (if used).</li>
        <li><strong>Diagnostics/analytics:</strong> retained for a limited period consistent with service provider settings and operational needs.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>We recommend that you periodically review and delete backups/files in Google Drive if you no longer want them stored.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>11) Security</h2>
      <p>
        We use reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect data, such as secure communication and standard platform protections.
        However, no method of transmission or storage is completely secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.
        You are responsible for maintaining the security of your device and Google account.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>12) User Responsibilities</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Ensuring the accuracy of information you enter.</li>
        <li>Securing your device (screen lock, OS updates, malware protection).</li>
        <li>Safeguarding your Google account and managing Google Drive sharing permissions.</li>
        <li>Securely handling exported files (where you store them and who you share them with).</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>13) Your Rights (EEA / GDPR)</h2>
      <p>If you are located in the EEA, you may have rights including access, correction, deletion, restriction/objection, portability, and the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority.</p>
      <p>
        To exercise your rights, contact: <a href="mailto:aleksandrsvoz@gmail.com">aleksandrsvoz@gmail.com</a>.
        Because data is primarily stored locally and/or in your Google Drive, many actions can be performed directly by you within the App and Google Drive settings.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>14) International Transfers</h2>
      <p>
        The App may be used worldwide. Some service providers (e.g., Google/Firebase) may process data on servers located outside your country, including outside the EEA.
        Where required, appropriate safeguards are used according to provider practices and applicable law.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>15) Children’s Privacy</h2>
      <p>
        The App is not directed to children under 13 (or under 16 in the EEA where applicable). We do not knowingly collect personal data from children.
        If you believe a child has provided personal data, contact us and we will take appropriate steps.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>16) Changes to This Policy</h2>
      <p>
        We may update this Policy from time to time. The updated version will be published with a new “Effective Date.”
        If changes are material, we will provide additional notice within the App where required by law.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>17) Disclaimer</h2>
      <p>
        The App is provided on an “AS IS” and “AS AVAILABLE” basis. We do not warrant that the App will be uninterrupted or error-free.
        This does not affect any mandatory rights you may have under applicable consumer protection laws.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>18) Limitation of Liability</h2>
      <p>
        To the maximum extent permitted by law, the Owner/Controller is not liable for indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages arising from your use of the App, including loss of data or loss of profits.
        This limitation does not exclude liability that cannot be excluded or limited under applicable law and does not affect mandatory consumer rights.
      </p>
